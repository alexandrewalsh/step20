      <h1>Alex's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alexandre Walsh, but I go by Alex. 
          I am a rising third-year at UCLA studying Computer Science and I'm from San Diego, CA. 
          I was born in Barcelona, however, and, fun fact, I got to meet the president of Catalunya 
          (Jordi Pujol) when I was 4 years old! I love exploring LA (like in the below picture, 
          where I watched Caravan Palace perform at the Wiltern Theater) and was really looking forward to 
          getting to explore the Mountain View area this summer, but am glad that I still get the amazing opportunity 
          to work with Google and the Google Fi team this summer :)</p>
