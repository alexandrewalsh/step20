        <h1>A Bit About Alex</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Alexandre Walsh, but I go by Alex. I am a rising third-year at UCLA studying Computer
          Science and I'm from San Diego, CA. I was born in Barcelona, however, and, fun fact, I got to meet the
          president of Catalunya (Jordi Pujol) when I was 4 years old! I love exploring LA (like in the picture, where I
          watched Caravan Palace perform at the Wiltern Theater) and was really looking forward to getting to explore
          the Mountain View area this summer, but am glad that I still get the amazing opportunity to work with Google
          and the Google Fi team this summer :)
